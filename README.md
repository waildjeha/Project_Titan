# Project 1.2: Manned Mission to Titan Simulation

This project simulates a manned mission to Titan, one of Saturn's moons, and back to Earth. It features:

* **Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) Solver:** For accurate trajectory calculations.
* **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Visualizes the trajectories of planets and the spaceship.
* **Orbital Mechanics Simulation:** Accurately simulates bringing the spaceship into orbit.

## System Requirements

This project is designed to run on most systems, as it doesn't have intensive performance requirements. However, you must have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the simulation:

**1. Install Maven:**

* Ensure you have Maven installed and configured in your system's PATH environment variable.
* Download Maven from the official [Apache Maven website](https://maven.apache.org/).
* Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

**2. Clone the Repository:**

* Open your preferred command-line terminal (e.g., Terminal on macOS/Linux, Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows).
* Use the following command to clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/waildjeha/Project_1_2](https://github.com/waildjeha/Project_1_2)
    ```

**3. Navigate to the Cloned Folder:**

* Use the `cd` command to navigate to the cloned project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Project_1_2
    ```

    * Alternatively, you can open the cloned folder directly in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE), such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

**4. Build and Run the Project:**

* **Clean the Project:**
    * To clean any previously built artifacts, run the following Maven command:

        ```bash
        mvn clean
        ```

* **Run the Simulation:**

    * **Using an IDE:**
        * If you are using an IDE, navigate to the `src/main/java` directory.
        * Locate the `App.java` file.
        * Run the `App.java` file as a Java application within your IDE.
    * **Using the Command Line:**
        * If you prefer to run the simulation from the command line, use the following Maven command:

            ```bash
            mvn javafx:run
            ```
